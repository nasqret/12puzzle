# 12-puzzle
This project contains a complete proof of the isomorphism of the symmetry group of the 12-puzzle and the full symmetric group S_12.

## 12-puzzle setup
The puzzle consists of 3 intersection circles and 12 beads. One is interested in moving the circles while the coloring configuration changes. The challenge is to swap colors (two-color version) or more complicated cases.

This paper was written fully with GPT 5 Pro and under my supervision. The current version was reiterated 6 times by GPT 5 Pro. The complete LaTeX file was automatically generated in GPT 5 Pro. 

The second part is Streamlit code with visualization app. This app contains autosolver for the puzzle. The whole code was generated by GPT 5 Pro based on the paper.
